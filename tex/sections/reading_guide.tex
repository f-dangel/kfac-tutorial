\section*{How to read this document?}

\paragraph{Layout} This document has a somewhat unusual structure in that it uses a parallel column format.
The left column contains the main text with explanations and mathematical descriptions.
The right column accompanies the left one with code snippets to make the ideas precise in code.
It can safely be skipped if you are in a rush.
